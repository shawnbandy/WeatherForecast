Application Description: This program uses the open source APIs of OpenWeather to display a different types of weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and a weather condition icon. Today's weather, as well as the next 5 day forecast, is displayed for the city that was entered and submitted by the user. The city that was searched for is placed into a search history, where the user can click on that city name to redisplay the information. A reset button was included to clear the search history, and all data persists through refreshes through localstorage.
